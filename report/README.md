# Report for project

Based on template by lecturer.

To duplicate my LaTeX installation:

```basH
apt install texlive-latex-extra
apt install python-pygments
```

I use the script `./c.sh` to produce the pdf. I use this mapping to invoke script from inside vim:

```vim
nnoremap Ã¸ :!./c.sh<cr>
```
